---

This sketch uses the noise() function to create an animated texture that resembles the surface of water. The noise() function can take up to 3 variables, so by using the the third variable with frameCount() the noise becomes animated. The colours are picked out of a colour array that could contain any 5 colours allowing you to change the feel of the sketch.
